1. I am creating an online shop program in which this is my footer section. a picture of my footer is included for context. Within my footer, i want the text below the title "Help and information" to be turned into dummy links as opposed to staying as plain text.

Turns my plain text in the footer into dummy links (mimicing a working webpage). AI inserts "Gesture Detector" and "MouseRegion"

A GestureDetector in Flutter is a widget that detects and responds to user touch interactions, such as taps, drags, and swipes. 
A MouseRegion in Flutter is a widget that detects when the mouse pointer enters, exits, or hovers over its child, enabling hover effects and cursor changes.
