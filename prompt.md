## Prompts
1. I am creating an online shop program in which this is my footer section. a picture of my footer is included for context. Within my footer, i want the text below the title "Help and information" to be turned into dummy links as opposed to staying as plain text.

- Explanation of Generation: Turns my plain text in the footer into dummy links (mimicing a working webpage). AI inserts "Gesture Detector" and "MouseRegion"

- Private Notes: A GestureDetector in Flutter is a widget that detects and responds to user touch interactions, such as taps, drags, and swipes. A MouseRegion in Flutter is a widget that detects when the mouse pointer enters, exits, or hovers over its child, enabling hover effects and cursor changes.
